# Tracking App

> This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), along with the redux template.

## About The Project

> In this project, I developed a frontend web application (tracking app), used to track time spent on any given task for a given activity.
> This is the frontend app that connects to the [Backend app](https://github.com/mke2111/tracking-app-api) hosted on Heroku
